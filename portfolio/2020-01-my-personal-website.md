I've relaunched my website one or two times now, but somehow I was never really happy with it. After a while, it always bumbled along and rarely got new content. Most of the time I just wanted to try out a new framework or a special lib. Once that was done, I unconsciously checked the whole thing off.

With this sweetie here it should be different, I have already limited myself to the essentials in the design. The thing should go live as soon as possible in its first version and also look good. I do have a lot of ideas for further extensions, visible or under the hood. So stay tuned.

In total, I've been sitting on the site for maybe just under a month, after work on weekends and days off. It was built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11ty</a>, the styling was done by me. I wanted to keep everything as lightweight as possible, so I was able to do well without massive frameworks. You can find the repository <a href="https://github.com/stbnvll/simonstubenvoll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
