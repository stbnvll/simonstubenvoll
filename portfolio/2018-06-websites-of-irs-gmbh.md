<a href="https://irs-nbg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integrated Realization Services GmbH</a> in Nuremberg offers its customers a wide range of services. These include <a href="http://web-to-media.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing management portals</a>, <a href="https://genow.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">programmatic printing</a>, <a href="https://gecona.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile publications</a> and agency works. Unfortunately, for a long time, the websites of the individual divisions did not suggest that they all came from a single source. Together with the management, I started the relaunch of these.

First, the content of the individual sites had to be brought to a common denominator. This made it possible to create modules that could be filled as desired and arranged on the corresponding websites. From now on the user should notice when he switches to another service, but not have to find his way around again. The design language continues to work with the familiar corporate identity of IRS.

During the programmatic implementation it was important to me to be completely independent of frameworks. If there is no maintenance by developers for a long time, the code written with Plain JS will continue to work without problems. By the way, content finds its way into the theme via WordPress and can be created by anyone with the appropriate rights.
