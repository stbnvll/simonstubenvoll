At <a href="https://irs-nbg.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRS GmbH</a> I started with my master thesis in which I developed an alternative to Adobe’s DPS folios using web technologies. After the takeover, I was significantly involved in the design and implementation of a native as well as a POS application, which was tailored to the client’s needs.

In the day-to-day business, I was responsible for the conceptual and programmatic aspects of the company’s various marketing activities. When dealing with design topics I always had the opportunity to give free rein to my creativity and affinity for aesthetics. I left the company in December 2018.
