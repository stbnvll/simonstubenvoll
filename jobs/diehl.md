At the <a href="https://www.diehl.com/metall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diehl Metall Stiftung & Co. KG</a> I found my first job as a working student. There I was responsible for the typesetting and layout of brochures and mailings. Retouching, montage and image processing were also part of my duties. I created printable data and passed them on to printing companies. I also assisted in the conception, coordination and communication of projects with external partners. I left the company in February 2015.
