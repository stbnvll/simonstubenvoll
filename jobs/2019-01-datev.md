At <a href="https://www.datev.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DATEV eG</a> I’m part of a cross-functional feature team and take over the technical lead of the frontend. I’m significantly involved in the development of an UI for customer-oriented visualization of Big Data in the payroll area. With the emerging MVP, the company wants to expand its portfolio in the online sector and open up new sales markets.

I also try to advance the user experience through conceptual, design and consulting work. I furthermore support the team in the role of a security engineer. I’m still working there today.
