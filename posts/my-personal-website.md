I've relaunched my website once or twice now, but somehow I was never really happy with it. After a while it always bumbled along and rarely got new content. Most of the time I just wanted to try out a new framework or a special lib. Once that was done, I subconsciously checked the whole thing off.

With this sweetie here that should be different. So I needed a rock solid base to build on again and again whenever I wanted to. My choice therefore fell on <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11ty</a>, the styling was handmade at the beginning. I wanted to go live with a first version as soon as possible.

A few weeks later I decided to take the help of <a href="https://www.tailwindcss.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tailwind CSS</a> and redesign the face of my website a bit. Content and structure should not change, I had already laid the foundation for that.

No idea what will happen next. But if you're interested, you're welcome to drop by from time to time or even take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/stbnvll/simonstubenvoll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repository</a>.
